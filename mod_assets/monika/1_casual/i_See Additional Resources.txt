Monika does not currently have a casual outfit which has been confirmed to be okay to use in any project. The placeholder "0.png" images in these folders are needed to correctly add the "u" prefix to Monika's uniform images (it's a weird quirk in the code's logic). If you'd like to experiment with a casual outfit for Monika, see the Additional Resources folderâ€”there is a sample outfit you can place here for testing purposes at least.
