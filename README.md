MC's Revenge is a mod for [Doki Doki Literature Club](https://ddlc.moe). The ZIP can be downloaded [from my website](https://yujiri.xyz/works/mc_revenge/). The premise is that starting with Act 2, MC starts to become meta-aware like Monika, seeing the graphical glitches and everything. He doesn't yet realize what's happening or remember Act 1, but he might, depending on your choices.

The complete guide is [here](https://yujiri.xyz/works/mc_revenge/guide) (only mild spoilers unhidden).
